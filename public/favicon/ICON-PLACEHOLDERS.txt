<!-- PLACEHOLDER: icon-192.png and icon-512.png -->
These files are required for PWA (Progressive Web App) support.

You need to create:
1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels) - Standard app icon
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels) - High-resolution app icon

These icons should be simplified versions of your logo/brand that work well
at small sizes and when placed on different background colors.

IMPORTANT: The manifest.json currently uses only standard icons (not maskable).
If you want to support maskable icons (icons that adapt to different device shapes):
- Create a separate icon-512-maskable.png file
- Ensure important content is in the center "safe zone" (about 80% of the image)
- Avoid placing text or logos too close to the edges
- Add it to manifest.json with "purpose": "maskable"

You can use existing favicons as a base and scale them up, or create new 
simplified versions specifically for PWA icons.

Tip: Use https://maskable.app/ to test your maskable icon design.
