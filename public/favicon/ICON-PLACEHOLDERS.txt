<!-- PLACEHOLDER: icon-192.png and icon-512.png -->
These files are required for PWA (Progressive Web App) support.

You need to create:
1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

These icons should be simplified versions of your logo/brand that work well
at small sizes and when placed on different background colors.

For maskable icons (icon that adapts to different device shapes):
- Use the same 512x512 icon
- Ensure important content is in the center "safe zone" (about 80% of the image)
- Avoid placing text or logos too close to the edges

You can use existing favicons as a base and scale them up, or create new 
simplified versions specifically for PWA icons.

Tip: Use https://maskable.app/ to test your maskable icon design.
